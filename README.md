# Email Classification with Naive Bayes
This project aims to classify emails from the Enron Email Dataset as spam or not-spam (ham) using Naive Bayes Model.

## File Contents and Purpose
1. **data** 
   * **ham**: contains all the ham emails for training.
   * **spam**: contains all the spam emails for training.
   * **testing**: contains a mixture of ham and spam emails for testing.
2. **naivebayes.py**: consists of functions for learning the parameters of the model using the training data and measuring the model's performance using the testing data. 
3. **util.py** : consists of functions for parsing the data in the files.

## Dataset
The data is a preprocessed version of the Enron email database. See V. Metsis, I. Androutsopoulos and G. Paliouras, *Spam Filtering with Naive Bayes – Which Naive Bayes?” Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS 2006), Mountain View, CA, USA, 2006*.
